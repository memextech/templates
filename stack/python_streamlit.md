# Python Streamlit App Implementation Guide

## MANDATORY FIRST STEP: Clone the Template Repository

**You MUST clone this template repository as your starting point:**
https://github.com/memextech/streamlit_modal_app

### Implementation Process:

1. **CLONE the template repository** into your project directory
   - This is your BASE - do not create files from scratch
   - Use: `git clone https://github.com/memextech/streamlit_modal_app .` 
   - Or copy all files from the template if git clone isn't appropriate

2. **USE the template as-is** for:
   - Project structure
   - requirements.txt format
   - Modal deployment configuration
   - app.py base structure

3. **UPDATE/CUSTOMIZE** the template files for your specific app:
   - Modify app.py with your business logic
   - Add dependencies to requirements.txt as needed
   - Update README.md with your app description
   - Keep Modal deployment files intact

### DO NOT:
- ❌ Create app.py, requirements.txt, or deployment files from scratch
- ❌ Skip cloning the template
- ❌ Build your own project structure
- ❌ Ignore the template's Modal configuration

### WHY THIS MATTERS:
The template includes production-ready Modal.com deployment setup and Streamlit best practices that would take significant effort to recreate correctly.

**ALWAYS: Clone → Customize → Deploy**
